# Once Human Utility Bot Privacy Policy

###### Last updated and effective: July 20, 2024

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot Once Human Utility Bot#7310.

---

By default, Once Human Utility Bot does store any data. If a server member with the Administrator permission uses the setup command to set output channel, then the server’s automatically-generated guild and channel Discord ID (for example, 398998849026261003) will be stored in the bot’s database. No other data relating to the server is stored. Once Human Utility Bot never stores data specific to users.

The data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored in a locally hosted file.

To contact me, the developer of Once Human Utility Bot, if you want the data to be removed or for any other reason, you can create a GitHub issue here.

Also see [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

Thanks for using Once Human Utility Bot!
